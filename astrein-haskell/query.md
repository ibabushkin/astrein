# ASTrein's Haskell Backend
ASTrein's Haskell backend implements querying for definitions in Haskell source
code. It supports all of Haskell 2010 and numerous (all?) GHC extensions.

At the time of writing, the querying capabilities are deemed complete, for a
complete reference of the implementation's limitations and features see
[this issue](https://github.com/ibabushkin/astrein/issues/1).

The querying syntax is exactly as described in the language-agnostic document
[here](https://github.com/ibabushkin/astrein/blob/master/astrein/query.md).
