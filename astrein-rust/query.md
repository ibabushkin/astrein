# ASTrein's Rust Backend
ASTrein's Rust backend implements querying for definitions in Rust source
code. It supports the more or less latest nightly Rust (and might break on
older versions). However, an effort is made to avoid breaking things whenever
possible.

At the time of writing, the querying capabilities are not yet present, for a
complete reference of the implementation's limitations and features see
[this issue](dead link, yo).

The querying syntax is exactly as described in the language-agnostic document
[here](https://github.com/ibabushkin/astrein/blob/master/astrein/query.md).
